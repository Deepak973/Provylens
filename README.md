## About

**Project Goal**: Our vision is to revolutionise the supply chain industry through blockchain technology for secure end-to-end tracking and management. We aim to ensure authenticity and safety of products with decentralised and tamper-proof systems.

**ProvyLens**: This project aims to develop a blockchain-based supply chain logistics system that will enable end-to-end tracking of products, enhance transparency, and ensure secure data sharing between supply chain stakeholders. The system will be designed to provide real-time visibility into the movement of goods from production to delivery, improve efficiency, and increase trust and accountability throughout the supply chain.

The project team will work on designing and developing a decentralised, tamper-proof, and immutable system that ensures the integrity of data and facilitates seamless communication between all parties involved in the supply chain.

Each product will be assigned a unique identifier that can be traced back to its origin, allowing users to verify its authenticity and ensure that it has not been tampered with or counterfeited. The platform will also incorporate smart contracts to automate supply chain operations, reduce costs, and increase efficiency, while maintaining transparency and accountability throughout the process. By providing consumers with a reliable and transparent supply chain, ProvyLens aims to improve trust and confidence in the products they purchase, while also reducing waste, fraud, and environmental impact.
